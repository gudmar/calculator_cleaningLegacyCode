# calculator_cleaningLegacyCode

This task is to provide a class that can be used as a calculator. It takes a string expression in standard notation, parses it and returns a result. It does not use eval or any other build in function. Just pure parsing.

Original calculator was my first JS script ever written. I knew nothing about clean code. I just thought a while and wrote this code. Later, after getting familiar with some codding good practicies, design patterns, TDD, clean code principies I decided to clean this code a little bit.

## Licence for font
Original calculator, created years ago, used a font, that was created by Rob Meek, who has a copy right for this. According licence (attached in repo) there is a permissoin for not commertial usage.

## OriginalNotCleanedVersoin 
This folder contains all files with original calculator I wrote years ago.

## WorkingDir
Here I am working to have job done. 

## Cleaned Version
Here I wil place final calculator class with tests when job is done. 

## Future work
As next exercise I am going to write a calculator as my first React exercise

## Progres
Work started with only 60% tests pass. Not the best result. Original calculator does not support correctly many boundry cases
